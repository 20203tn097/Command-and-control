System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM)

The SRUM is a Windows feature that tracks the last 30 to 60 days of resource usage, such as:

Application and service activity
Network activity, such as packets sent and received
User activity (I.e. launching services or processes).
In a database (SRUDB.dat) on the host, this can be found at C:\Windows\System32\sru\SRUDB.dat.
