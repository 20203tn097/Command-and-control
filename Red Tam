Identify critical information: “Critical information includes, but is not limited to, red team’s intentions, capabilities, activities and limitations.”
Analyse threats: Threat analysis refers to identifying potential adversaries and their intentions and capabilities.
Analyse vulnerabilities: An OPSEC vulnerability exists when an adversary can obtain critical information, analyse the findings, and act in a way that would affect your plans.
Assess risks: “Risk assessment requires learning the possibility of an event taking place along with the expected cost of that event.”
Apply appropriate countermeasures: Countermeasures are designed to prevent an adversary from detecting critical information, provide an alternative interpretation of critical information or indicators (deception), or deny the adversary’s collection system.
