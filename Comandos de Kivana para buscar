Range queries allow us to search for documents with field values within a specified range. 

Consider the following example dataset:

alert_id	alert_type	response_time_seconds
1	Malware Detection	120
2	Unusual Login Attempt	240
3	Suspicious Traffic	600
4	Unauthorized File Access	300
5	Phishing Email	180

To search for all documents where the "response_time_seconds" field is greater than or equal to 100, then the query for you to use is:
response_time_seconds >= 100
Here's one for less than 300:
response_time_seconds < 300
And, of course, these can be combined with an AND operator.
response_time_seconds >= 100 AND response_time_seconds < 300
The query will return the documents with alert_id 1, 2, and 5.

Ranges are beneficial for dates, which you'll get to try in Kibana in a later section. There are different ways to search by ranges, and one way is by specifying the date by following specific formats. 
@timestamp<"yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ"
The time is optional, so you can also do the following:
@timestamp>yyyy-MM-dd

Trying it out in KibanaLike in the previous task, you can try the above queries by changing the index, this time to ranges.
Use the query response_time_seconds >= 100 AND response_time_seconds < 300 and you should see the following results:

To search for all documents where the "host_name" field is similar, but not necessarily identical to "serber", you can use the following query:
host_name:server01~1

As you can see, the "~" character indicates that we are doing a fuzzy search. The format of the query is as follows:
field_name:search_term~fuzziness_value

The format when doing a proximity search is like so:
field_name:"search term"~slop_value

As you can see, the "~" character is used, followed by a slop_value. Note that "~" is used for both proximity searches and fuzzy searching; the difference is that in proximity searches, the slop value is applied to a phrase enclosed in quotation marks (").

Let's continue. Consider the following example dataset:

log_id	log_message
1	Server error: failed login attempt.
2	Login server - failed on startup with error.
3	Login to server failed successfully.
4	Server: Detected error in connection.


log_message:"server error"~4  OR "login server"~1
incident_comments: "detected negative"~2
Event_Type:/(S|M).*/
Description:/(s|m).*/ AND /user/.*
affected_systems.affected_files.file_name:/client_list.*/
